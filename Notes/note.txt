Dear grandpa,

Happy birthday! Hope you are well. It's good to hear you have many visitors.
Thank you very much for your christmas present. I'm considering buying some new ping pong bats - we put back together the table in our basement and I've been getting quite a bit of practice in over the holidays. I'll be back at college soon, looking forward to it. 
Thanks again!

Robert
